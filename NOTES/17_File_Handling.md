# File Handling:

- File Handling means the process of handling files i.e read, write files, etc.
- Several Programming Languages have the concept of file handling and its implementation is little complicated.
- But in python, its easy and short
- Python treats files in two ways: text or binary
- Each line of code includes a sequence of characters and they form a text file.
- Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun.
- There are both advantages and disadvantages of file handling

## Advantages:

- It allows to perform many operations like: creating, reading, writing, appending, renaming and deleting files
- Python provides a user-friendly interface for file handling, making it easy to create, read, and manipulate files.
- File-handling functions work across different platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Disadvantages:

- Can cause a lot of errors when the code is not carefully written.
- Can cause security risks in case of modifying sensitive files on the system.
- File handling operations in Python can be slower than other programming languages when dealing with large files.

## open() function:

- The key function for handling files is: open()
- Because Before performing any operation on the file like reading or writing, first, we have to do is open that file
- open() is an inbuilt function in Python
- Takes two parameters: filename and mode of opening
- Syntax:

```
f = open(filename, mode)
```

## Types of modes for opening file:

- "r" : (Default). opens an existing file for Reading. Error if file not exist
- "a" : opens an existing file for Appending. Creates new file if not exist. It wonâ€™t override existing data.
- "w" : opens an existing file for writing. Creates new file if not exist. If the file already contains some data then it will be overridden
- "x" : for creating file. Error if file already exists
- "t" : (Default) for handling file in text mode
- "b" : for handling file in Binary mode(e.g images)
- "r+" : To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will be overridden.
- "w+"": To write and read data. It will override existing data.
- "a+": To write and read data. It will override existing data.

# SYNTAX:

## 1. Open a file for reading:

```py
f = open("fileName.txt")

# same as

f = open("fileName.txt","rt")

# r for read , t for text-mode
# both are default values
```

## 2. Open a file on the server:

> In this file is located in the same folder as python

```
# Ravi.txt

My name is Ravi. I am a computer Science Student
```

- open() fun returns a file object which has read() method for reading the content of file:

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt","r")
print(f.read())
```

```
#output
My name is Ravi. I am a computer Science Student
```

> If file is in different location, mention path:

```py
# Error
f = open("C:\Users\ASUS\Ravi.txt","r")
print(f.read())
```

- The above code will show Error because the backslashes in the file path are being interpreted as escape characters.

- So either double the backslashes in the file path or use a raw string by adding an 'r' prefix before the string.

```py
# Using double backslah:
f = open("C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Desktop\\Ravi2.txt")
print(f.read())
```

```py
# using raw string
f = open(r"C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Ravi2.txt")
print(f.read())
```

- Always close() when done
- Alternatively, you can use the with statement to ensure proper handling of file closure:

```py
with open(r"C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\Ravi2.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

- This will automatically close the file when the block is exited, even if an exception is raised

## 3 . Reading File:

- By default read() methods returns whole text
- We can specify how many characters to return:

```py
# Returns first 10 characters
f = open("Ravi.txt","r")
print(f.read(10))
```

> readline() Method:

- returns one line

```py
# Reads one line of file
f = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
```

- For reading two lines:

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())
```

- For reading entire file line by line:

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)
```

## 4. Writing in a File:

- Two modes:

```
1. "a" : Append at the end of file
2. "w" : overwrite entire file
```

> 1 . Append("a")

```
# Ravi.txt
My name is Ravi. I am a computer Science Student
```

```py
# Appending
f = open("Ravi.txt","a")
f.write("I am From Bhubaneswar")
f.close()

#open and raed after appending:
f = open("Ravi.txt","r")
print(f.read())
```

```
# Ravi.txt

My name is Ravi. I am a computer Science Student. I am From Bhubaneswar

```

> 2 . Overwrite("w")

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt","w")
f.write("All content deleted")

f = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
```

```
# Ravi.txt

All content deleted
```

> writelines:

- method expects a list of strings to overide the existing data.

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt", "w")
L = ["This is Delhi \n", "This is Paris \n", "This is London \n"]
f.writelines(L)
f.close()
```

```py
mylist = ["My name is Ravi \n","I live in Bhubaneswar \n", "My age is 23\n"]

file = open("Ravi.txt", "w")
file.writelines(mylist)
file.close()

file = open("Ravi.txt","r")
print(file.read())
```

## 5. Closing File:

- Always close file in the end

```py
f = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
f.close()
```

- Due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file

## 6. Creating New File:

- Three modes:

```
1. "x" : creates new file. Error if file exists
2. "a" : Append. Creates a new file if file doesnot exists
3. "w" : Write. Craetes a new file if doesnot exist
```

- EX:

```py
# creates a new empty file
f = open("fileName.txt","x")
```

```py
# creates a new file if it does not exist
f = open("fileName.txt","w")
```

## 7. Deleting File:

- first import OS module
- Run os.remove() function
- Ex:

```py
# Remove the file "Ravi.txt"

import os
os.remove("Ravi.txt")
```

- If File doesnot exist, it will show Error.
- To avoid it, check if file exist before deleting:

```py
import os

if os.path.exists("Ravi.txt"):
    os.remove("Ravi.txt")
    print("file deleted")
else:
    print("File doesnot exists")
```

## 8. Deleting Folder:

- os.rmdir() deletes entire folder

```py
import os
os.rmdir("folderName")
```

- Only Empty Folders can be removed.
- To avoid getting error, check whether folder exists before deleting it.

```py
import os
if os.path.exists("demo"):
    os.rmdir("demo")
    print("folder deleted")
else:
    print("File doesnot Exists")

```

## Creating Folder:

- os.mkdir() creates folder

```py
import os
os.mkdir("demo")
```

```py
import os
if not os.path.exists("demo"):
    os.mkdir("demo")
    print("folder created")
else:
    print("Folder Already Exists")
```

## 9. with Statement:

- Another way of dealing with filr handling:

> without with statement:

```py
f = open('file_path', 'w')
f.write('hello world !')
file.close()
```

> Using with statement:

```py
# using with statement
with open('file_path', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello world !')
```

- Automatically closes the file

# QUESTIONS:

> Read Each line present in a file

```py
file = open('Ravi.txt', 'r') # opening with the reading mode.

# Printing every line one by one in the file
for each in file:
    print(each)
```

> Extract a string that contains all characters in the file.

```py
file = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print (file.read())
```

> Read a file using the with statement.

```py
with open("Ravi.txt") as file:
    data = file.read()

print(data)
```

> Read the first five characters of stored data and return it as a string:

```py
file = open("Ravi.txt", "r")
print (file.read(5))
```

> Split lines while reading files in Python.

- The split() function splits the variable when space(default) is encountered.

```py
with open("Ravi.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.readlines()
    for line in data:
        word = line.split()
        print (word)
```

> Creating a File. Write two lines and then close the file

```py
file = open('Ravi.txt','w')
file.write("This is the write command")
file.write("It allows us to write in a particular file")
file.close()
```

> Open a file and append one line

```py
file = open('Ravis.txt', 'a')
file.write("This will add this line")
file.close()
```

> Using the written statement along with the with() function.

```py
with open("Ravi.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World!!!")
```

print(x) # We Are Learning Python

```

```py
fname = input("Enter file name: ")

# Implementing all the functions in File Handling

- using all concepts of file hnadling in this example:
