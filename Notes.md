- Computers are actually not that intelligent. Its us who instructions on which they depend to perform any application
- Computers only understand machine code(i.e 1s and 0s)
- Every instructions that are given to computer are converted into binary code(1,0) which are then interpreted by the computers to p[erform tasks.

- For Example i speak hindi...and my friend speaks Tamil. So its difficult for me to communicate. So i need someone to translate what he speaks
- So computers understand binary code. It don't understands english. It doesnot understand the instructions we provide them
- So how do they then perform the tasks?
- Here comes the programming. Programming here acts as an translator which will convert our instructions to machine or binary code.

- Its very difficult for us to understand the machine code in binary
- Directly translating our instructions into machine code is very difficult, almost impossible(it will take very very long time)
- Each program have millions and millions of those 1s and 0s.
- So how we suppossed to translate our instructions to computers
- Here programming Language come into play.
- Programming Language acts as middle-man. It will translate our instructions into machine code(series of 1s and 0s)
- Programming languages acts as interpreter that take the instructions you give in english and convert them into machine code(binary) for the computers to understand.
- There are several programming languages. Each having their own unique uses:
- Lang like: Python, Java, C++ are general purpose to perform variety of computational tasks.
- Lang like HTML, CSS, JS: used for making websites

> Low Level vs High Level languages:

- Low Level: Assembly or c: closer to binary
- High Level: Java or Python

- The lower the level, the more it will resemble as machine code.

# How To Write Code

- For that we need IDEs
- IDEs are the place where programmers can write, run, debug code.
- IDEs also turn our code(or instructions) into machine code and run it to the computer to produce results.
- Other featues: Error checking, Auto-fill, better UI

> Syntax:

- Like a real language, programming language also has certain rules, which is called syntax
- Smillar to Grammar in real language.
- Each programming lang has unique syntax or rules.
- Breaking these rules will cause error.
- Ex: Declaring variables syntax in different Languages:

```java
//Java
int x = 5;
```

```py
x = 5;
```

```js
var x = 5;
```

- Remember computers are extremely dumb. Even if you forget one semi-colon, the whole program will not run and show as Error.
- Its same in real language. Even if we forget one comma whole meaning changes:
- For Ex:

```
Lets Eat, Grandma
```

```
Lets Eat Grandma
```

- So same goes with Programming Lang.

- Consols is the Developer tool which helps to fix all kinds of error in our program
- Concatenation: Adding Strings together

# Variables:

- Variables are something that can store information.
- Give cardboard Box Example
- Each variable has a type , name and a piece of information stored inside it.
- consider name as a label on the cardboard box.

> Integer:

- stores Integer value: -3, 0, 1,10, 1500, etc

> Boolean:

- Can store only two values: true or false
- Mostly used in conditional statements(if, else, switch).

> Floats & Doubles:

- Both of these variables types are floating point data types.
- can store numbers with decimal places.
- Diff between floats and double
- Floats can store numbers with precision upto 32 bits.
- A Double can store numbers with precision upto 64 bits.

> Why are variables useful?

- helps to keep track of things like user's name, score, etc which we can add, modify or refer later.

> What happens when we define a variable:

- When a variable is defined, the computer creates a space in the memory that stores the variable name and its contents.

- There is one rule in naming variables: they must be one continous string
- Ex:

```py
my name = "Ravi"; #Wrong
```

- To name it correctly, we have different types of cases
- These cases provide good readibility

# Conditional Statements

- In programming language, brackets include a segment or block of code
- If the condition inside the parenthesid is true, all of the code within the brackets will run
- But python uses columns and whitespaces to detect where a piece of code starts and ends
