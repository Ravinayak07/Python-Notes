- Computers are actually not that intelligent. Its us who give instructions on which they depend to perform any application.
- Computers don't understands english. So It also doesnot understand the instructions we provide them
- Computers only understand instructions in the form of machine code(represented by binary digits i.e 1s and 0s). This is also called low-level binary code which the CPU can directly interpret and execute.
- So how do Computers then perform the tasks ??
- Here comes the programming.
- Programming Language acts as middle-man or translator. It will help us to translate our instructions into machine code(series of 1s and 0s), which are then interpreted by the computers to perform tasks.

- So programming languages and compilers make it easier programmers to write complex programs without directly dealing with binary code. These high-level languages are then translated into binary code by compilers or interpreters to be executed by the computer's hardware.

- The process of converting high-level programming languages (such as Python, Java, C++, etc.) into machine code is handled by a compiler or an interpreter. These programs translate the human-readable code written in high-level languages into the binary instructions that the computer's CPU can execute.

- There are several programming languages. Each having their own unique uses:
- Lang like: Python, Java, C++ are general purpose to perform variety of computational tasks.
- Lang like HTML, CSS, JS: used for making websites

> WHAT IS PROGRAMING?

- Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Computers understand a language called "machine language," which consists of binary code (0s and 1s). However, writing programs in machine language is extremely complex and tedious. That's where programming languages come into play.A programming language is a more human-readable and understandable way to communicate with computers. It allows you to write instructions in a structured and organized manner. As a beginner, you'll be working with high-level programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.

> STEPS OF CREATING A PROGRAM:

1. Understanding the Problem: Analyze the task you want the computer to perform and break it down into smaller steps.

2. Writing Code: Use the programming language to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute.

3. Compiling or Interpreting: Depending on the language, you might need to compile your code into machine code or directly run it through an interpreter.

4. Testing and Debugging: Run your program, check the output, and fix any errors (bugs) that might occur.Iterating and Improving.

> ALGORITHMS AND FLOWCHARTS:

- Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a task. They are essential for problem-solving and efficient programming, but you can learn them as you progress in your programming journey.Flowcharts are graphical representations of algorithms that help visualize the logical flow of a program. While they can be useful for planning and understanding complex programs, they are not required at the beginning.

> WHAT IS PYTHON?

- Python is a high-level, versatile, and beginner-friendly programming language.
  It was created to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners like you.

# How To Write Code

> Syntax:

- Like a real language, programming language also has certain rules, which is called syntax
- Smillar to Grammar in real language.
- Each programming lang has unique syntax or rules.
- Breaking these rules will cause error.
- Ex: Declaring variables syntax in different Languages:

```java
//Java
int x = 5;
```

```py
x = 5;
```

```js
var x = 5;
```

- Remember computers are extremely dumb. Even if you forget one semi-colon, the whole program will not run and show as Error.
- Its same in real language. Even if we forget one comma whole meaning changes:
- For Ex:

```
Lets Eat, Grandma
```

```
Lets Eat Grandma
```

- So same goes with Programming Lang.

- Consols is the Developer tool which helps to fix all kinds of error in our program
- Concatenation: Adding Strings together

# Variables:

- Variables are something that can store information.
- Give cardboard Box Example
- Each variable has a type , name and a piece of information stored inside it.
- consider name as a label on the cardboard box.

> Integer:

- stores Integer value: -3, 0, 1,10, 1500, etc

> Boolean:

- Can store only two values: true or false
- Mostly used in conditional statements(if, else, switch).

> Floats & Doubles:

- Both of these variables types are floating point data types.
- can store numbers with decimal places.
- Diff between floats and double
- Floats can store numbers with precision upto 32 bits.
- A Double can store numbers with precision upto 64 bits.

> Why are variables useful?

- helps to keep track of things like user's name, score, etc which we can add, modify or refer later.

> What happens when we define a variable:

- When a variable is defined, the computer creates a space in the memory that stores the variable name and its contents.

- There is one rule in naming variables: they must be one continous string
- Ex:

```py
my name = "Ravi"; #Wrong
```

- To name it correctly, we have different types of cases
- These cases provide good readibility

# Conditional Statements

- In programming language, brackets include a segment or block of code
- If the condition inside the parenthesid is true, all of the code within the brackets will run
- But python uses columns and whitespaces to detect where a piece of code starts and ends

# OVERLOOK:

- Its very difficult for us to understand the machine code in binary
- Directly translating o ur instructions into machine code is very difficult, almost impossible(it will take very very long time)
- Each program have millions and millions of those 1s and 0s.
- So how we suppossed to translate our instructions to computers
- Here programming Language come into play.
- Computers understand only binary code because of the way digital electronic circuits work. At the most basic level, computers are composed of electronic components like transistors, which can be in one of two states: on (represented by a voltage level, often denoted as 1) or off (represented by no voltage, denoted as 0). These two states form the foundation of the binary number system.

> Low Level vs High Level languages:

- Low Level: Assembly or c: closer to binary
- High Level: Java or Python

- The lower the level, the more it will resemble as machine code.
